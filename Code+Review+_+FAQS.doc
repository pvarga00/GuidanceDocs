    <h1>Code Review : FAQS</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong>Why are Code Reviews important f=
or a team?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>A team which code reviews will grow in qua=
lity maturity. Code reviews raise the level of knowledge sharing, provide t=
he opportunity for feedback with respect to best practices and provide a hi=
gher chance of detecting issues faster. A code review is a technical conver=
sation which dives into topics of code quality, functionality and doing the=
 right thing to make your code more maintainable, testable and functional! =
It's a great opportunity for everyone on their team to bring their unique t=
ake on how to make your product better at a very early phase in the SDLC.&n=
bsp;</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong>What is required to shift the mindset to=
 a culture that makes Code Review part of their process?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>An honest effort. In some situations, code=
 reviews seem like a burden, because we're all pressured to get stuff done =
as quickly as possible. But giving CRs the mental energy they deserve, by m=
aking process changes such as branch protection strategies, and building in=
 time for them in your process is what we should all do to make code review=
s first class citizens in the development cycle. If we take those actions, =
and allow ourselves the necessary mental effort to perform a code review, w=
e will give our selves a chance to see value from it! Code reviews provide =
us with a chance to invest in our foundation every single day! It's a way o=
f ensuring the house our code is built upon is being improved and strengthe=
ned.&nbsp;<strong>(4:20 =E2=80=93 6:05)</strong></p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:&nbsp;</strong>How does Code review align with SAFe pri=
nciples and our House Commitmentz?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Applying Systems Thinking. Systems thinkin=
g, refers to the idea that a system has many inter-related components, and =
that everyone "must understand and commit to the purpose of the system". Co=
de reviews provide a perfect mechanism to do just that. When a team perform=
s CRs, it's team member's are generally looking at code that they haven't w=
ritten themselves. This provides an opportunity for each team member to fur=
ther their understanding of a component he or she hasn't worked on, and why=
 it is being developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second point of the "Innovation" House Committment states that we sh=
ould all continue pushing the envelope and the status quo. Code Reviews giv=
e us a safe space to adopt status go, and eliminate status quo. A code revi=
ew is a great place for us all to provide technical feedback for our teams,=
 and push the team toward innovation. It's a wonderful opportunity to make =
improvements to our products super early, which we usually don't get a chan=
ce to do later.</p>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp;Which OKR does this speak to and how wil=
l it help us achieve the OKR? (Question does not appear)</p>
<p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>I think the CR process speaks to Objective=
 1 (Deliver what we promise with reliability), Key Result 3, which speaks t=
o improving our client and business partner's experience by reducing incide=
nts. The reason for this connection, is that the earlier we can get more ey=
eballs on code, the higher percentage chance we have of detecting bugs lead=
ing to incidents. Although we can't guarantee finding a bug, anything we ca=
n do to raise the chance of one being discovered is a worth while effort in=
 my books.</p>
