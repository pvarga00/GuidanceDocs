    <h1>Disaster Recovery and High Availability</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <h3 id=3D"DisasterRecoveryandHighAvailability-Whatisdisasterrecover=
y?">What is disaster recovery?</h3>
<p>Disaster recovery basically is about recovering from an issue. This usua=
lly means preparing a disaster recovery plan which details how to recover/r=
eplace every component of a system(networking, database, servers etc) in ca=
se of a failure. Having a good disaster recovery plan ensures we can recove=
r from a failure quickly. This also means we don't experience a huge downti=
me thereby improving our availability.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"DisasterRecoveryandHighAvailability-Whatishighavailability?">What=
 is high availability?</h3>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">Availability is used to describe the =
period of time when a service is available, as well as the time required by=
 a system to respond to a request made by a user. High availability is a qu=
ality of a system or component that assures a high level of operational per=
formance for a given period of time. A system must have a high level of ava=
ilability so that users always have a good experience when using the system=

<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">Av=
ailability is often expressed as a percentage indicating how much uptime is=
 expected from a particular system or component in a given period of time, =
where a value of 100% would indicate that the system never fails. For insta=
nce, a system that guarantees 99% of availability in a period of one year c=
an have up to 3.65 days of downtime (1%). We must strive to achieve a high =
percentage of availability.&nbsp;<span style=3D"color: rgb(0,51,102);">A wi=

pan style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">When setting up robust production systems,=
 minimizing downtime and service interruptions is often a high priority. Re=
gardless of how reliable your systems and software are, problems can occur =
that can bring down your applications or your servers.</span><br><span styl=
e=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">Implementing high availability for your infrastruc=

n></span></h3>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">One of the goals of high availability=
 is to eliminate single points of failure in your infrastructure. A single =
point of failure is a component of your technology stack that would cause a=
 service interruption if it became unavailable. As such, any component that=
 is a requisite for the proper functionality of your application that does =
not have redundancy is considered to be a single point of failure.</span></=
p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: auto;">To eliminate single points of failure, each=
 layer of your stack must be prepared for redundancy. For instance, imagine=
 you have an infrastructure consisting of two identical, redundant web serv=
ers behind a load balancer. The traffic coming from clients will be equally=
 distributed between the web servers, but if one of the servers goes down, =
the load balancer will redirect all traffic to the remaining online server.=
</p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: auto;">In the above scenario, if the load balancer=
 itself goes offline, then we don't have an option.&nbsp;<span style=3D"col=
or: rgb(0,0,0);">Redundancy alone cannot guarantee high availability. A mec=
hanism must be in place for detecting failures and taking action when one o=
f the components of your stack becomes unavailable.</span></p>
<p><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);"><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,0);">Fa=
ilure detection and recovery for redundant systems can be implemented using=
 a top-to-bottom approach: the layer on top becomes responsible for monitor=
ing the layer immediately beneath it for failures. In our previous example =
scenario, the load balancer is the top layer. If one of the web servers (bo=
ttom layer) becomes unavailable, the load balancer will stop redirecting re=
quests for that specific server.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style=3D"margin-left: auto;">This approach tends to be simpler, but it h=
as limitations: there will be a point in your infrastructure where a top la=
yer is either nonexistent or out of reach, which is the case with the load =
balancer layer. Creating a failure detection service for the load balancer =
in an external server would simply create a new single point of failure.</p=

<h3 style=3D"margin-left: auto;" id=3D"DisasterRecoveryandHighAvailability-=
Distributedapproach">Distributed approach&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With such a scenario, a distributed approach is necessary. Multiple redu=
ndant nodes must be connected together as a cluster where each node should =
be equally capable of failure detection and recovery. This approach still h=
as some limitations which can be solved by using floating IP's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"DisasterRecoveryandHighAvailability-Systemcomponentsrequiredforhi=
ghavailability">System components required for high availability</h3>
<p style=3D"margin-left: auto;">There are several components that must be c=
arefully taken into consideration for implementing high availability in pra=
ctice. Much more than a software implementation, high availability depends =
on factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Environment:</span>&nbsp;if all your servers are located in the s=
ame geographical area, an environmental condition such as an earthquake or =
flooding could take your whole system down. Having redundant servers in dif=
ferent datacenters and geographical areas will increase reliability.</li>
<li><span>Hardware:</span>&nbsp;highly available servers should be resilien=
t to power outages and hardware failures, including hard disks and network =
interfaces.</li>
<li><span>Software:</span>&nbsp;the whole software stack, including the ope=
rating system and the application itself, must be prepared for handling une=
xpected failure that could potentially require a system restart, for instan=
ce.</li>
<li><span>Data:</span>&nbsp;data loss and inconsistency can be caused by se=
veral factors, and it's not restricted to hard disk failures. Highly availa=
ble systems must account for data safety in the event of a failure.</li>
<li><span>Network:</span>&nbsp;unplanned network outages represent another =
possible point of failure for highly available systems. It is important tha=
t a redundant network strategy is in place for possible failures.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id=3D"DisasterRecoveryandHighAvailability-WhatSoftwareCanBeUsedtoConfig=
ureHighAvailability?">What Software Can Be Used to Configure High Availabil=
ity?</h3>
<p>Each layer of a highly available system will have different needs in ter=
ms of software and configuration. However, at the application level, load b=
alancers represent an essential piece of software for creating any high ava=
ilability setup.</p>

ion-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"=

<p>Moving up in the system stack, it is important to implement a reliable r=
edundant solution for your application entry point, normally the load balan=
cer. To remove this single point of failure, as mentioned before, we need t=
o implement a cluster of load balancers behind a Floating IP. Corosync and =
